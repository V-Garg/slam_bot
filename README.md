## SLAM LiDAR ROBOT

This code is used for a robot that utilizes a LiDAR sensor and ROS2 to run SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). The basic robot and code outline was from a tutorial from Josh Newans on his YouTube channel, Articulate Robotics. Within my project, I utilized ROS2 Humble, Gazebo for the simulation, and a Raspberry Pi 5 and an Arduino Uno for the actual robot brain and motor controller.
